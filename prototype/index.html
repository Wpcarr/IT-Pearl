        <h2>Location of the Buffalo River and Watershed</h2>
        <p>The Buffalo National River, in Northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated in the United States. The Buffalo River is <em>153 miles (246 km)</em> long. The lower 135 miles (217 km) flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is designated the Buffalo National River. The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of the Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of Erbie, and finally crosses a portion of the <strong>Salem Plateau</strong> just before joining the White River. The Park is home to the state's only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a National Wild River.</p>

<h4>The Hog Farm Contamination</h4>
<blockquote>
    In 2012, C&H Hog Farms was granted a permit to operate on a major tributary of the Buffalo River. The facility contained over 6,500 hogs, as well as storage areas for their manure. In 2019, the company reached a deal with the State of Arkansas to cease operations on the river. The then-governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, subsequently announced a moratorium on large confined animal feeding operations in the river's watershed. In January 2020, the Arkansas Legislature struck down rules set by Hutchison banning similar operations on the river.<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_National_River">Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>
<h5>What People Think</h5>
<P><q>Its turquoise waters flow through the Ozark Mountains in northern Arkansas for 150 miles, past majestic bluffs and secluded waterfalls, before joining the White River. People come from all over the state and around the world to canoe, swim, fish and camp along the Buffalo. This is where lasting memories are made.</q></P>
